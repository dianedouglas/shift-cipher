Write an encoder program where the user creates a shift cipher. The user inputs a shift number, like 3, and a phrase to encode. The phrase is then encoded using the desired amount of shift. 

For example, a shift of 3 on the word “apple” would move each character forward 3 steps in the alphabet, creating the word: dssoh.

If a shift exceeds the number of characters in the english language, it should loop back to the beginning of the alphabet. Z + 3 would translate to C. 

Number digits should also be shifted on their own. So a shift of 3 applied to the number 10 should equal 43.
